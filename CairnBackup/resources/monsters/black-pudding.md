# Black Pudding

12 HP, 11 STR, 5 DEX, 3 WIL, devouring touch (d8)

- Giant, brainless blobs of black jelly driven only by their insatiable hunger.
- Moves along walls and across ceilings. Squeeze through holes and cracks with ease.
- Immune to mundane attacks, save fire. Normal attacks splits the Black Pudding. creating two Puddings that share HP and STR.   
- **Dissolve**: On **Critical Damage**, armored targets lose 1 Armor point. STR loss to unarmored targets is _permanent_.
