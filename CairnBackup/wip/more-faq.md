# More FAQ

### How do detachments work?

### How do you increase or decrease the difficulty and outcome of a save without advantage or disadvantage?

### How does autohit work?
Imagine

### Do monsters use the same combat rules as PCs (e.g. critical save)?
- Yes, monsters use the exact same combat rules as PCs, with the exception of rolling on the [Scars Table](/cairn-srd#scars-1) at 0 HP.

### How does having 10 inventory slots actually work? 
When a Fatigue occupies an inventory slot, that slot cannot be used for items, equipment, spellbooks, etc. When the Fatigue is cleared, the inventory slot is once more available.

#### What happens when there are no more empty slots, and Fatigue is applied to a slot that includes an item?
The player must drop an item to accommodate the Fatigue.

### What are examples of deprived conditions?

### How does the Armor cap work? What's the difference between Armor of equal values?

### How does initiative in combat work?
A standard combat scenario would work like this:

#### Round 1
- PCs make a DEX save. Those who successfully pass go before the enemies (collectively one "side"). They go in whatever order they wish; the results however are simultaneous.
- All enemies go, in whatever order the Warden chooses; the results are simultaneous.

#### Round 2
- _All_ PCs (including those that failed the original DEX save) get to go in whatever order they wish. The results however are simultaneous.
- _All_ enemies get to go in whatever order the Warden chooses; the results however are simultaneous.

#### Round 3
- All PCs get to go, as per round 2.
- All enemies get to go, as per round 2.

And so on.

### From Chris:
INTENT - What are you trying to do?  
LEVERAGE - What makes it possible? If outcome and cost are assured, go to Impact.  
STAKES - What's at risk? If thereâ€™s no risk, go straight to Impact.  
ROLL - Make a Save or a Luck Roll.  
IMPACT - Show the consequences of their action, honouring the established Stakes, and move things forward.  
(based off the procedure I wrote for Ask the Stars but it's a good fit for ITO too)  
so jumping over the pit is the classic:  
INTENT: Pretty straightforward, get to the other side.  
LEVERAGE: Is it an easy enough jump? Just do it. Too far? Come up with a better plan. Risky? Let's keep going.  
STAKES: So seems like "fall down the pit" is the obvious stake here, but take this moment to talk about whether it's an "ow my ankle" pit or an "impaled on spikes" pit. You sure you still want to put this down to a DEX Save instead of just finding a safe way over? (for our example let's say they're in a rush and have to leap)  
ROLL - DEX Save or fall down into the pit  
IMPACT - Damage for anybody going into the pit, based on the stakes we set earlier establishing the nature of the pit
