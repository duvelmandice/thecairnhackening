# Why made you decide to stop being dealt in?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Blessing** | You sold your soul to a Fortune Demon to never lose a bet, and its unfortunately looking for you to return your end of the bargain. |
| 2    |**Luck** | You don't know if you were cursed or just born without luck, but routinely lose every big bet you make. You did gain a crew in your hometown who always invited you to their games, though. |
| 3    |**Sorrow** | After Ol' Major died in that last horse vs. pugilist boxing match, you decided you could never return to gambling again. And you'll never forgive that horse who trampled him. |
| 4    |**Addiction** | Realizing you hit a low point when you started participating in Ooze Breed Shows, you called it cold turkey. You still feel bad for all the agility coursework you forced on Lil' Ochre. |
| 5    |**Vengeance** | In a completely unfair turn, the Warlock you won the pot from cursed you to never be able play another hand. |
| 6    |**Boredom** | You find no thrill in cards, dice, races or anything of the like. You hope the dungeon can provide your kicks. |


# What was your grandest prize?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    | **Witch's Tooth**         | It was the last thing the bog hag could match you with, her divining tooth. She said if you rattle it around in your mouth, when you spit it out the patterns in your phlegm can be read by a seer. |
| 2    |**Foreign Currencies** | Over the years some coins not Realm-minted snuck their way into your winnings. You're not even sure this stuff is real copper, silver or gold, and it bears peculiar visages on each coin. |
| 3    |**Marble Wolf** | Under the direct light of a full moon this miniature wolf statue will prowl around and follow your commands. |
| 4    |**Fancy Darts** | Oiled rose wood and polished brass adornments, you have a nice box with three extremely precise and impressive darts. |
| 5    |**Cantankerous Beast** | The local cat lady had a few to spare, and you were feeling generous so you agreed it matched your bet. Unfortunately the feline never ended up taking to you. It does seem to always become alerted when anyone tries to sneak up on it, though. |
| 6    |**Circlet of the Dwarfs** | When placed upon a non-dwarf's head, this slender silver circlet causes the wearer to grow a massive, stately beard. After removing the circlet the beard proceeds to fall out in a fairly scratchy fashion over the course of a week. |
