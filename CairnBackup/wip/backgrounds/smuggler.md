# Why did you stop smuggling?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Pursued** | A paladin of the lawful deities of economies & trade swore an oath to see you apprehended. Fortunately they are still tied up getting the correct permits to come after you, but you fear the day they get their paperwork in order. |
| 2    |**Unnatural Encounter** | Delivering trinkets to shadowy cove, your patron revealed itself to be a tentacled thinking fish who psychically monologued about drenching the surface to return the planet to the control of a oceanic empire. |
| 3    |**Blackmailed** | The local rogue's guild threatened to go directly to the Bishop, your uncle with proof that you have been delivering relics to the cults of chaos. They now demand you seek out treasures for them. |
| 4    |**Revenge** | Appalled to discover that the "rare heirloom bottles" the dark-robed figures had you trek back and forth between coteries contained the spirits of the deceased, you swore an promise to free any remaining soul part-damned by your deeds. |
| 5    |**Catastrophe** | Your entire supply was sunk deep under waters, the duke you were delivering it to demands you pay, and a population of clamfolk are infuriated at the pollution you caused. |
| 6    |**Addicted** | Having made it big smuggling a very rare myconid growth to rich merchants of the port cities, you tried to sample just one brewing of mushroom tea. The other realms of existence it revealed to you was so intoxicating, but the price of a single serving so high that you knew you had to get as far away as possible. |

# What's one item that "fell off of the wagon"?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Frost Giant's Spit** | A bottle of azure liquid that stays exceedingly cold, can temporarily freeze anything it is poured upon. Enough fluid remains to coat a hypothetical forearm. |
| 2    |**Dark Creeper's Night Soil** | This bag of foul smelling fertilizer can cause seeds or bulbs to full grow within 24 hours. You really hope the name is just a joke. |
| 3    |**Insurrectionist Doom Tablets** | Clay tablets pressed with worrying amount of praise to the dark gods, coupled with some really good criticisms of the exploitation done by nobles and clergy. |
| 4    |**Displacer Beetles** | Tiny box filled with beetles that are always closer or further than they appear. |
| 5    |**Faulty Holy Symbols** | A bunch of vampires were trying to circulate holy symbols that would fail mid-turning among the clerical order. You have about a dozen of these. |
| 6    |**Shrieker's Treat** | One vial of a particularly nasty poison that forces its victim to continually scream until passing out and potentially suffering permanent brain damage. |


## A few ideas
- An odorless vial of dark liquid, perfect for dashing into a "friend's" wine cup. Before you know it they'll be spilling secrets, as well as the contents of their stomach the following morning.
- **False Teapot**  A teapot that holds two liquids. Tip the spout high and the contents of a secret chamber spill instead. Good for avoiding drinking too much, or letting your trading partner drink more than they'd realized.
