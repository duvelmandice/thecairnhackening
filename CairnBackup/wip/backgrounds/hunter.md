## Why did you abandon the hunt? Roll 1d6:

|      |                   |                                                              |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Empathy** | Tracking and killing your quarry in new territory, you unwillingly enraged a local spirit. Enraged, it cursed you with the ability to experience the fear of any nearby creature. You are now an excellent tracker, but cannot bring yourself to hunt. Take an acorn-shaped peace charm, 1 charge. Casts _Pacify_; recharge by planting it in well-lit dirt and water for a day. |
| 2    | **Betrayal**  | You privately confronted a respected elder about their misdeeds and were rudely dismissed. After nearly losing your head to a crossbow bolt, you broke all ties and fled. Before you left you grabbed the elder's prized talisman: a silver knife (d8). They want it back.|
| 3    | **Remorse**  | You neglected your duties during the _Great Hunt_, and an important person was killed as a result. Cast out, you learned to survive on your own for the first time. Take a homemade stun bomb (one use) and a bad attitude.  |
| 4    | **Bloodlust** | You grew bored of hunting wild beasts like elk, bear and snow-cat. You searched for new prey and always came up short. Then you set your sights on more _intelligent_ prey, and never looked back. You're now a hunter for hire, and strict vegetarian - no exceptions.. Take a poison-tipped spear (d8+d8) and a bottle of poison (d4 STR damage). |
| 5    | **Starborn** | You were born under an auspicious sign, and great things were expected of you. They never seemed to manifest. You left in search of your destiny. You can always tell where you are by the stars, and bear an ugly birthmark. |
| 6    | **Conviction** | After a close-call with a Horror of the Night, you were instilled with conviction.  You have adopted a strict code of ethics to only kill that which eats people, and to never eat flesh again. You became a slayer of monsters, wandering towards wherever you feel you are needed. Take a Silver Sword (d8). The damage is (d8+d8) against creatures that have tasted the flesh of your kind. |

## What time of day do you typically hunt? Roll 1d6:

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Dawn** | You're most alert at first light, and rarely require breakfast. You do not become deprived after missing a single day's rations. If you haven't eaten by the second day you gain both days' Fatigue.|
| 2    |**Morning** | You know the calls of birds and how to bend them to your will. Take a young falcon (3 HP, 3 STR, 14 DEX, 11 WIL, claws (d6), follows simple whistle commands) Occasionally it bites you. |
| 3    |**Day** | You are a skilled rider. Attacks against unmounted combatants are enhanced so long as you are on a horse. Take an old nag from the plains (+2 slots, fast enough). |
| 4   |**Afternoon** | You learned to hunt alongside dogs, tracking your prey by smell, spoor, and blood. Your scent-hound (2 HP, 5 STR, 13 DEX, 8 WIL, bite (d6), loyal to a fault) is never far from you, and responds to even the most subtle cues.|
| 5    |**Dusk** | Your quarry typically lived in trees and dense forests. As a result you are an excellent climber, and know the behavior of most arboreal creatures. Take a bird whistle.  |
| 6    |**Midnight** |For years you stalked large deer and elk through tundra and forest, never staying in one place for more than a few hours. You don't need as much sleep as most; once per day you can lose a single Fatigue without having to rest. You always sleep with one eye open.  |
