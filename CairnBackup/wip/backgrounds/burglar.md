|      |              |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Judged**   | The last time you were caught they took an ear, next time you'll probably be executed. |
| 2    | **Reformed** | The Acolytes of Law convinced you that your actions brought unholy Chaos into the world. Now you seek to pay for your past transgressions. |
| 3    | **Cursed**   | Rumors that the last house you breeched were a witch's hut were entirely true. Now when you sleep you have dreams of that house being hoisted on dozens of legs, crawling ever towards you. |
| 4    | **Soured**   | While out robbing another, you returned to find your home had been burgled. Having tasted your own medicine you found it very bitter, and resolved to leave it behind. |
| 5    | **Pursued**  | A bounty has been put on your head. You hope to find lands where no one recognizes you, or to earn enough gold to perhaps repay your crimes. |
| 6    | **Bungled**  | You just were never good at it - you were continually caught in the act, assaulted by your targets, repeatedly found yourself having to make escaped by leaping into manure piles. Maybe adventuring will be different? |



## What was the most outstanding thing you stole?

|      |                                         |                                                              |

| 1    | **Lucky Coin**                          | This coin seems to always land the side you intend upwards.  |
| 2    | **Monkey's Paw**                        | An unattached paw of a money. When something is placed in its palm the fingers wrap around the object with an unbreakable grip. Squeezing the wrist stump causes the hand to release its grip. |
| 3    | **Fossilized Legend**                   | A palm-sized hunk of amber containing the miniature skeleton of a winged serpent. |
| 4    | **Makani's Magnificent Messaging Cube** | An elaborately-decorate cube with a removable lid. Retains one sentence spoken into it, and will replay the exact wording in the speaker's voice once when opened. |
| 5    | **Coin-Purse of Copper Conversion**     | A peculiar leather purse that will immediately convert any coin or gems placed within to copper, bearing the markings or minting of the region that the owner is currently within. |
| 6    | **Suspicious Song Bird**                | A cage containing one warbler that will begin chirping when in the presence of a statement that is unlikely to be true. |
