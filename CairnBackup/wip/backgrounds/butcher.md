## Why Did You Leave Butchery Behind?

|      |                              |                                                              |

| 1    | **Bankruptcy**               | Your practice failed turn any sort of a profit.              |
| 2    | **Guild Standards**          | Things that the guild believed to be "unsanitary" and "unethical" were a major part of your practice. You were stripped of your title. |
| 3    | **Hemophobia**               | Despite being a fan of the art of the cut, the sight of blood leaves you faint. |
| 4    | **Cursed**                   | The nearby Necromancer made it pretty impossible for you to safely do your job, on account of all the animals rising to eat your brains mid-butchering. |
| 5    | **Plant-Based Druidism**     | Your community was ran by a circle of Druids that made it very clear that if it wasn't made out of legumes, it wasn't welcome. |
| 6    | **One Too Many Close Calls** | Having gained a wide array of scars, lost a few fingers, and spilled quite a bit of your blood, you thought plundering tombs sounded safer. |

## What Strange Thing Did You Find On The Job?

|      |                               |                                                              |

| 1    | **Cleaver of Returning**      | Your knife is either enchanted or built in such a fashion that it boomerangs back to you when thrown. Unfortunately catching it is an extremely harrowing process. |
| 2    | **Bottle of Sumptuous Blood** | One of your primest cuts bled a liquid that makes any beast foam at the mouth. Pouring this out in the vicinity of animal will render it ravenous. |
| 3    | **A highly Obedient Hog**     | The one you couldn't kill, you have a very reliable pig that follows your every step. |
| 4    | **A Lucky Femur**             | One of the bones of a cow you slaughtered was riddled with runes. Surely it provides you some protection. |
| 5    | **Regenerative Grounds**      | A fistfull of ground beef grows a cubic inch of new beef every day. Does not preserve yesterday's meat any longer, though. |
| 6    | **Nesting Best**              | The last cow you butchered ended up being hollow, containing a sheep within. It walks and talks like any other sheep, but you suspect that there's an even smaller animal within. |
