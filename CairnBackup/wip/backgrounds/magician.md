## Why did you quit magic?

|      |                |                                                              |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Prosecuted** | A series of witch hunters swore to have you drowned.         |
| 2    | **Debt**       | While performing a routine stage show, a being born from the shadows cast by your candles offered you power for your soul, mistaking it as a potential part of your act you obliged. |
| 3    | **Loss**       | You mastered the ability to make things disappear, but you could never find where they went, eventually every pet you ever had was lost to the ether. |
| 4    | **Heckler**    | One especially insensitive lay-about child always snuck into your shows and would shout just the worst jibes, to the enjoyment of your measly crowd. |
| 5    | **Sabotage**   | Someone snuck into your storage and ruined your saw box, leading to your on-stage dismemberment of an audience participant. |
| 6    | **Thievery**   | The look-alike you used for tricks stole your entire routine and has completely drawn your crowd away from you, painting you as the fraud. |


## What trick was your specialty?

|      |                |                                                              |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Mentalism**      | You have a significant chance of being able to guess a card drawn by another being from a deck in your control. |
| 2    | **Escapery**       | A few classes of knots pose only a moderate threat to your freedom. You can also probably regurgitate a swallowed key or small item with repulsive frequency. |
| 3    | **Death Defiance** | Surviving being submerged for several minutes was something you routinely practiced, or at least you are able to suppress panicking before losing consciousness. |
| 4    | **Levitation**     | Floating a stationary target weighing no more than 12 stones was a trick you received the least lukewarm applause for. |
| 5    | **Iron Jaws**      | You've discovered the correct technique of eating glass and a variety of other traditionally inedible substances. |
| 6    | **Spiritualism**   | With a bit of setup, smoke and mirrors, you have a very minor chance of convincing someone that a partner of yours is their deceased loved one. |
