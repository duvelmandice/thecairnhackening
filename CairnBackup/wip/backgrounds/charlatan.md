## How was your fraud exposed?

|      |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Too many of your "patients" were reporting a complete recovery from their ailments, and your name grew famous as a result (much to your chagrin). Somehow, you were a half-decent doctor (or incredibly lucky). Obviously you had no option but to leave in search of fresh prospects. Start with bandages, ointment and a halfway decent sense of what's wrong with someone (3-in-6 chance). |
| 2    | Flush from your latest seduction, a wealthy widow/er - you disappeared to the usual place. Unfortunately, the spurned lover and their descendents hired a reknowned criminal gang (known associates, naturally) to ambush and bring you back. Your former "friends" tied you up and beat you senseless, but failed to account for your exceptional contortionist skills. Soon you were free, but penniless. At least you still have your looks, as well your talents. You can wriggle out of nearly anything (literally, or through charm). |
| 3    | You can mimic another's mannerisms, voice, and speech pattern perfectly within seconds of meeting them. You do this effortlessly, almost unconsciously. In fact, you've never felt at home in your own skin, and are prone to bouts of shivering, shaking, and _deprivation_ if you go more than a day without practicing your craft. Friendships are difficult to maintain, as they often end in anger, or confusion after learning who you really are, and what you can do. Now you travel through the land, looking for the cure you fear will never come. Take a makeup kit (bulky). |
| 4    | You can play the part of the wise military general, the gregarious merchant, the slack-jawed farmer, or any other assortment of archetypes, should the mood strike you. You are also a compulsive risk-taker and provocateur, relishing adventure and excitement over common sense. Your latest plots went quite poorly, resulting in a memorable escape from prison, right beneath the noses of the city watch. You start with a captain's uniform, a _harmless_ ceremonial sword (bulky) worth 60gp, and a boquet of flowers. |
| 5    | You have a knack for sleight of hand magic: card tricks, coins behind the ear, disappearing pigs, etc. Occassionaly you have even passed it off as the real thing, selling yourself as a great worker of magic. Unfortunately, your hubris made a **Witch** quite unhappy, and in return you were _cursed_: whenever you lie, your money disappears - wherever it is. You have no idea where it goes. An odd quirk of this curse is that you can always tell when someone _else_ is lying, too. Start with an extra 2d20gp, a shortsword, and a bad attitude. |
| 6    | You were a self-proclaimed speaker for the dead, selling your services as a bridge from this world to the Great Beyond. In actuality, you possessed a spellbook of **[Raise Spirit](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/#raise-spirit)**, cleverly hidden beneath your seance table. Ineviteably a skeptical patron investigated your workmanship and discovered your secret. Cast out, you fled with what you could. Take the spellbook, a bundle of scarves, and an incomplete knowledge of astrological charts. |

## What do you carry that might identify you?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Royal Crest** | In truth, you were born into royalty. A life of crime just seemed more... interesting. You can never go back now, not after what the things you've done. Used sparingly, this token of your former status opens a lot of doors, among other things. Of course, your family has eyes everywhere, and they want it back.   |
| 2    |**Pop's World-Famous Miracle Oil** | Your father - your _real_ father, that is - travelled from town to town, selling his strange, smelly homemade concoction as a miracle cure, sword cleaner, or even as salad dressing. You can't bring yourself to rid of it. It is very, very, slippery.         |
| 3    |**Surgeon's Soap** | A block of lye and ash, mixed with something vile-smelling. Rubbing it on your skin will make the affected area completely transparent, revealing the horrible biology within. You were pretty unsuccessful selling it, and have three bars of the stuff.  |
| 4    |**Goat Powder** | A fat tube of dark brown powder, made from the placenta of a she-goat collected moments giving birth. It is well-known that this tincture can cure a particular private affliction, for a while at least. When later a child is born from the coupling that traditionally follows a treatment, the parents are none too happy at their offspring's cloven feet and unusual eyes. Valuable (150gp), though you might need to discount it a bit if the buyer forgets from who they acquired it.  |
| 5    |**Cursed Sapphire** | You're not sure how you acquired it, but you can't seem to rid yourself of it, either. It appears very valuable; worth at least 200gp. And each time you try to spend it, it returns to your pocket! At first this seemed like a fine thing, but then a few of its former "owners" started talking to one another and marking you as the common denominator. You've heard a rumor that you could perhaps rid yourself of the damn thing by willingly trading it with someone aware of its unique "properties."      |
| 6    |**Wooden Sword** | A holdover from your time amongst the royals. An empty wooden sheath with the pommel of a sword sticking out. Pulling on it doesn't actually do anything; the thing stays put. Useful as a club (d6) or for the right costume. Something jiggles inside.       |

## If you are the oldest character in the party, your whole group is in Debt to....
The **Guild of Tricksters, Rapscallions, and Interlopers**. They demand that you either pay 1d4 years in backdated guild fees, or be booted from the organization, your personage besmirched forever. Also, they will take one of your thumbs as recompense. The trouble is, you can't remember actually _joining_ the Guild...
